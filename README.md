Quantum Key Distribution and RSA encryption analysis <br>


There is a large amount of documentation about quantum algorithms, how they work, and what they could be used for. 
However, there is little thought about the concrete application and integration of these ideas. 
The aim of this research is to better explore the future of quantum computing and how that will affect society. 
Specifically, it will explore current quantum algorithms, how these algorithms outclass current cybersecurity, 
and the defenses offered by classical and quantum computing to counteract these threats. 
The main goal is to show how individuals and organizations can keep their information confidential, integrous, 
and accessible in the coming quantum age. 

This goal will be achieved by an experiment where three virtual machines are set up with various encryption and decryption methods. 
Specifically, the experiment will test examples of RSA encryption against both classical and quantum methods of deciphering. 
The experiment will show how the quantum methods have the potential to decipher messages quicker than the classical methods. 
This will be done by evaluating the time complexity and run times of the quantum and classical algorithms. 
Then, different methods of classic data protection will be assessed as well. 
At the end of the experiment, preliminary and practical methods of protection against quantum algorithms should be clear.
